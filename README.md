# CoffeeShopWeb

## Introduction

**CoffeeShopWeb** is an online platform built with Django that allows users to explore and purchase coffee products. The landing page welcomes visitors with a personalized message and a background image of coffee, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for coffee lovers who enjoy savoring their brew from the comfort of their homes.

The website is not live <!-- if someone clones your repository and sets up the project as described in your README, they should be able to run the site on their local machine. The site itself isn't live on the internet, but the code is fully functional if set up correctly. -->
